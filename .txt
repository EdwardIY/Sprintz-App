 - only update date if the current date weekday doesnt include
the new date weekday at days?
- how can you make the author name dynamic?
- time remaing feature on cards
- on create task/group/sprint popup you should have the ability to search for past sprints/tasks/groups
- taks from sprints dont negatively affect your rating utill the sprint duration is over unlike regular tasks

- convert the given days and hours into miliseconds add add to new Date(new Date().getTime() + value)
this will give you a date string that is in the future when the task will be due
from this date string get the time from it with .toLocalTimeString() and get the day/mounth/year
from it with .toLocalDateString(). These to values will be th due value of each task. Inorder to check if it is due
you wil get the current .toLocalDateString() and .toLocalTimeString() and compare it to 
the two on the object if it matches that means it is due and up.

- alot of simlarities with the css and jsx of the popUps
maybe make it a little more modular and have less repeated code
