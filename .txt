 - only update date if the current date weekday doesnt include
the new date weekday at days?
- how can you make the author name dynamic?
- time remaing feature on cards
- on create task/group/sprint popup you should have the ability to search for past sprints/tasks/groups
- taks from sprints dont negatively affect your rating utill the sprint duration is over unlike regular tasks

- convert the given days and hours into miliseconds add add to new Date(new Date().getTime() + value)
this will give you a date string that is in the future when the task will be due
from this date string get the time from it with .toLocalTimeString() and get the day/mounth/year
from it with .toLocalDateString(). These to values will be th due value of each task. Inorder to check if it is due
you wil get the current .toLocalDateString() and .toLocalTimeString() and compare it to 
the two on the object if it matches that means it is due and up.

- alot of simlarities with the css and jsx of the popUps
maybe make it a little more modular and have less repeated code

 - tasksgroupsprint all have due date the diff is that group can hold multiple tasks and 
 sprint can hold multiple groups but task can only hold one task

 - add id to each task and add delete icon to task
 - need to have a feature where when a group is created a unique card pops up
    but has the same features as a regular task card. Need to add a unique id to each group
- Need to review and update CSS/folder stucture and components. Alot of the comps can
be resused like the basic title des and two buttons. Also need to make the edit/complete/delete
task componets resusable so I can use them for group and sprint
- Figure out the right way to do the popups/make group and task popups all resusable?

- Need to create edit comp for group and clean up props for comps because of last update
- Made edit task dynamic and resuable, with the plan of being able to use it when creating a group(worked) or editing(working on) a Group
still need to clean up props and types, maybe create a few interfaces next is to create edit group and check
maybe remove check for groups and just have a x and check option for them.

- Edit group is going to be identical to create group component
- finished edit group(FYI could probleby implement the components in a more intuitive way since both the task and group
create and edit component are almost identical so there is alot of reapeated code)
- shoul have one more input on create task and group that asks wether or not they want it to count towards there sprints score
 - edit and maybe com/del popups are going to be a little transparent

 - On create sprint need to figure out how I am going to show the created groups in a list format in sprint
 - EDit sprint percentage
 - Split progress into array first value us old value second is new value
 - On sign Up/sign In with google i need to first traverse the database and make sure that that email is not already being used
